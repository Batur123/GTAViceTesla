# GTAViceTesla

Project that I've done at junior year. Fun to do, made me discover machine learning in a fun way. Then, I tried to do some academic work, “Application of “The All Convolutional Net” Principles on AlexNet Model: Simple Autonomous Car on GTA Vice City” . It was my first attempt on academic report. It is amateur, but was able to present it on ISMAIL2017 Event held on Bogazici(Bosphorus) University.
Presentation was good, but report has lots of errors. But I like it to keep that way, since it is my first report on Machine Learning.
